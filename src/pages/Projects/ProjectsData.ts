      "This project involves the construction of a remote-controlled car using an Arduino microcontroller and DC motors. The car is controlled via a wireless communication module, allowing for remote operation. C++ programming language is used to write the code for the Arduino, which is responsible for controlling the motors and receiving commands from the remote controller. The car's speed and direction can be adjusted using the remote, and it also includes features such as obstacle detection and automatic braking. The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create a functional and user-friendly device.",

      "I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project where I leveraged my skills in C# and Windows Forms to create an engaging and visually captivating hexagonal chess game. I was solely responsible for designing the core game mechanics, which encompassed everything from crafting the intricate hexagonal board layout to implementing piece movements and enforcing the game's rules. One of the project's standout features was the development of a peer-to-peer local network multiplayer mode, allowing players to engage in direct gameplay interactions and enjoy the game with friends and peers.",

      "This project is the website you are currently on, built using the React framework. The website was designed from scratch utilizing the React-Bootstrap library. The website serves as an online portfolio and personal branding platform for me, showcasing my skills, experiences, and other projects. It was later deployed through Amazon Web Services. I believe this project showcases my design skills through the visually appealing layout and user-friendly navigation of the website, and also highlights my ability to effectively utilize cloud-based hosting solutions.",
