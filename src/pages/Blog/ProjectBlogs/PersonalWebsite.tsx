                <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                <p>This is my personal website, which you're currently viewing. It was built using <strong>React</strong> to create a smooth, dynamic, and <strong>mobile-responsive</strong> user interface. With an emphasis on performance, I kept external dependencies to a minimum, ensuring a fast and efficient browsing experience. The website showcases a clean, modern design, offering an intuitive navigation system and dynamic content rendering. Hosted on <strong>AWS</strong>, the site is designed for scalability and high availability, providing a reliable user experience. It serves as both a portfolio and a space for showcasing various projects, reflecting my skills in web development and software engineering.</p>
