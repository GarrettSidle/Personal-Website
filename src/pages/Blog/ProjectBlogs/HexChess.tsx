                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This WPF application offers a fresh take on classic chess, bringing hexagonal chess variants—such as Glinski, McCooey, and Hexofen—to a digital platform. Designed with both single and multiplayer modes, it allows users to experience the complexity and strategy of hexagonal chess in an engaging and user-friendly format.</p>
                <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
                <p>The application is built with C#, leveraging WPF for a clean and responsive interface. It features a custom <strong>Breadth-Depth Search</strong> system for move validation, dynamically calculating available moves in real-time and adapting to hexagonal board mechanics. The <strong>modular architecture</strong> facilitates easy addition of new game variants and components, while a lightweight chess evaluation system assesses board positions to guide strategic decision-making.</p>
                <h2>Variants</h2>

                </div>
                <p>Three unique hexagonal chess variants are implemented: <strong>Glinski</strong>, <strong>McCooey</strong>, and <strong>Hexofen</strong>. Each variant retains its distinct rules and board layouts. The chess engine accommodates each variant’s specific rules, seamlessly adapting move validation and board rendering to suit the selected game type.</p>

                <h2>Online Play</h2>
                <p>The application supports <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> multiplayer, allowing users to play against others with minimal setup. Using <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>, the game ensures smooth turns and state synchronization across devices. Advanced networking features, such as automatic reconnection enhance the multiplayer experience, making it intuitive and accessible.</p>
